The third assignment: single-cycle implementation
Author: Alexander Pronin <alexander.pronin.mipt@gmail.com>

03/03/15 0:25 version 1.0:

Start working with project. Created new objects:
- func_sim.cpp
- func_sim.h
- Makefile
- main.cpp

Changes in func_sim.h and func_sim.cpp:
- added main functions for implementation

Changes in func_instr.h and func_instr.cpp:
- added new operation types
- added helpful function for dump
- added some variables in FuncInstr to do execution

The task hasn't been done yet. Program doesn't work because of it.



03/04/15 0:15 version 1.1:

Changes in func_sim.h and func_sim.cpp:
- completed main functions

Changes in func_instr.h and func_instr.cpp:
- completed main functions

All changes haven't been debugged yet: main.cpp and Makefile are still empty.
So program doesn't work. However, main ideas of implementation are ready to be debugged.



03/07/15 0:44 version 1.2:

Changes in func_sim.h and func_sim.cpp:
- fixed some bugs

Changes in func_instr.h and func_instr.cpp:
- fixed some bugs

Changes in main.cpp:
- fixed some bugs
- now it's ready to work

Changes in Makefile
- completed
- now it's almost ready to work, I need to add one string for clean

Program is working. Memory hasn't been debugged yet. Some problems with dump of registers values.
New model of program counter is not implemented but program works correct with old one.
