03/03/15 0:25 version 1.0:

Start working with project. Created new objects:
- func_sim.cpp
- func_sim.h
- Makefile
- main.cpp

Changes in func_sim.h and func_sim.cpp:
- added main functions for implementation

Changes in func_instr.h and func_instr.cpp:
- added new operation types
- added helpful function for dump
- added some variables in FuncInstr to do execution

The task hasn't been done yet. Program doesn't work because of it.



03/04/15 0:15 version 1.1:

Changes in func_sim.h and func_sim.cpp:
- completed main functions

Changes in func_instr.h and func_instr.cpp:
- completed main functions

All changes haven't been debugged yet: main.cpp and Makefile are still empty.
So program doesn't work. However, main ideas of implementation are ready to be debugged.
