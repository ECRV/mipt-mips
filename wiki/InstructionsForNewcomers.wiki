== Step 1: creating Google account ==

Almost all the project's resources are connected with Google in one way or another. Therefore you need a valid Google account in order to be an active member of the project.

Our project has the strong naming requirement for the accounts of its members, which are listed below:

  * The name of you account should consists of only the full version of your first name, middle name, given name or the their first letters.
  * The only proper separator is a dot (`.`). Other signs are prohibited.
  * Digits in the account name are not allowed.

For instance, if you are _Vladimir Sergeevich Pupkin_ the following names are allowed for your account (from the most appropriate to less one):
  * `vladimir.pupkin@gmail.com`
  * `vladimir.s.pupkin@gmail.com`
  * `vpupkin@gmail.com`
  * `vladimir.sergeevich.pupkin@gmail.com`
  * `pupkin@gmail.com`
  * `vspupkin@gmail.com`
  * `vladimir.pupkin.mipt@gmail.com` (*only!* if all the previous names are already busy)

||<font color="red">*Note:*</font> Even if you already have a Google account, but its name does not meet the requirements above, you have to create a new account!||

After creating your Google account you can move to the following steps.

== Step 3: setting notifications in the project calendar ==
In order to properly plan our classes and to inform the project members about any changes in the schedule the project calendar is created. It is located at the google calendar service and can be examined by you after you have received the access.

||<font color="red"> *Note*:</font> do not proceed this step until your received a notification that you have been invited to the calendar!||

After you have received the invitation open [https://www.google.com/calendar/ the Google calendar page]. In the up right corner click the gear icon and open the settings:

On the settings page select the _"Mobile Setup"_ tab and follow instructions to register your phone number. It will allow you to receive sms notifications when something is changed in the calendar. The final page should look like the following:

Then go to the _"Calendars"_ tab, there you should see our calendar has already been added:
