== Step 1: install SVN software ==

See the chapter about svn installation in [SVNCheatSheet#How_to_install the SVN cheat sheet].

== Step 2: checkout ==

  # Decide what folder will be a destination of the checkout (i.e. where the working copy will be located).
  # Open the folder in the MSExplorer, make a right click at blank space, press _SVN checkout_
  # Put this address `https://mipt-mips.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/` in field _URL of repository_<br />||<font color="red">*Note:*</font> Use only *https* prefix, not http! Otherwise you won't be able to make commits!||
  # Press OK

== Step 3: modify ==

  # Open `members.txt`, which is located in your working copy, in any text editor.
  # Add your name and number on a new line in the end of the file.
  # Save the file. Notice that the small icon at the file is changed: now it is red. It shows that the file is modified

== Step 4: commit ==

  # Right click on blank space in the working copy folder.
  # Press _SVN commit..._
  # In the window that appeared type a message describing what you have changed. For our example, it should be:<br />`[trunk] Added <your name> to the list of members`.<br />|| <font color="red">*Note*:</font> do not forget to add `[trunk]` prefix and to replace `<your name>` by your name||
  # _Changes made_ area shows changed files that you're going to commit. *Please* check that there's nothing unnecessary.
  # Double click on a file name in this list will show you a diff for this file. *Please* check your changes.
  # TortoiseSVN will ask you for a password. You can find it in your Google profile [https://code.google.com/hosting/settings on this page].<br />||<font color="red">*Note:*</font> this password *is not* the same as your Google account password! It is used only to access to the svn repository.||
  # If the commit passes, the changes will be uploaded to the server and become available for other users.

= Instructions for Linux (console) =

== Step 1: checkout ==

  # Decide what directory will be a destination for checkout, make `cd` to it
  # Run there the following command to perform checkout (where `<user name>` is your email address):
{{{
svn checkout https://mipt-mips.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ . --username <your name>
}}}

== Step 2: modify ==
  #  Open `members.txt`, which is located in your working copy, in any text editor. For example, in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor) vim]:
{{{
vim members.txt
}}}

== Step 3: commit ==
  # Check your changes unsing `svn diff` command:
{{{
svn diff
}}}
  # Run the commit:<br><code>svn commit -m <your text message> --username <your google account name></code>Where `<your text message>` should be `[trunk] Added <your name> to the list of members`<br />||<font color="red">*Note*:</font> do not forget to add `[trunk]` prefix and to replace `<your name>` by your name||
  # You may be asked for a password. You can find it in your Google profile [https://code.google.com/hosting/settings on this page].<br />||<font color="red">*Note:*</font> this password *is not* the same as your Google account password! It is used only to access to the svn repository.||
